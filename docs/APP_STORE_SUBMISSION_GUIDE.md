## Pre-Submission Checklist

Before starting, ensure you have:

- ‚úÖ Active Apple Developer Program membership ($99/year)
- ‚úÖ Access to App Store Connect (https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
- ‚úÖ Production backend server URL ready
- ‚úÖ App icon created (1024x1024 PNG)
- ‚úÖ Test data and accounts ready
- ‚úÖ Privacy policy URL (required for App Store)
- ‚úÖ Support URL or email address

---

## Step 1: Add App Icon

### 1.1 Create the Icon

From your HTML design at `ux/app_icon.html`:

1. Open the HTML file in a browser
2. Take a screenshot or use a design tool
3. Create a **1024x1024 pixels** PNG image with:
   - No transparency (solid background)
   - RGB color space
   - 72 DPI or higher
4. Save it as `AppIcon.png`

### 1.2 Add Icon to Xcode

1. Open your project in Xcode
2. In the left sidebar, navigate to:
   ```
   MoneyInOne ‚Üí Assets.xcassets ‚Üí AppIcon
   ```
3. Drag and drop your `AppIcon.png` (1024x1024) into the "1024x1024" slot
4. Xcode will automatically generate all required sizes
5. Build and run to verify the icon appears correctly

**Alternative Method (if drag-drop doesn't work):**
1. Right-click on `AppIcon.appiconset` in Finder
2. Show Package Contents
3. Copy your `AppIcon.png` into the folder
4. Update the `Contents.json` file to reference your image

---

## Step 2: Configure Production Backend

### 2.1 Update Backend URL

Open `Services/APIService.swift` and update line 26:

```swift
// Change from:
return "https://your-production-api.com/api/v1"

// To your actual production URL:
return "https://api.yourdomain.com/api/v1"
```

### 2.2 Switch to Production Mode

Before submitting to App Store, change line 37 in `APIService.swift`:

```swift
// Change from:
static let currentEnvironment: APIEnvironment = .development

// To:
static let currentEnvironment: APIEnvironment = .production
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Only change to production mode when you're ready to submit!

### 2.3 Backend Requirements

Ensure your production backend:
- ‚úÖ Uses HTTPS (not HTTP) - Apple requires secure connections
- ‚úÖ Has a valid SSL certificate
- ‚úÖ Is accessible from the internet (not localhost)
- ‚úÖ Handles CORS properly if needed
- ‚úÖ Has proper error handling
- ‚úÖ Is stable and tested

### 2.4 Update Info.plist (If using HTTP for testing)

If you need to support HTTP temporarily:

1. Open `Info.plist`
2. The current configuration allows local HTTP connections
3. For production, consider removing or restricting this
